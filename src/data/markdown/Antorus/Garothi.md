### Positioning

- When you are targeted by "Fel Bombardment" move out to the side and run from the impact points. (See gif to the right)
- Run out for Eradication (Happens after the intermission)
- Soak SMALL circles if they are in melee range.  
- Run out of BIG circles if they are in melee range.

### Damage Profile

70% Physical | 65% auto attack    | 5% special
30% Magic (Fire)

### All Tanks

Your job on this fight is purely to have a tank in melee range at all times (except for eradication or when you have bombardment)
Swap on each bombardment cast and ensure you have some form of mitigation up for the first swing after the hit (to avoid spikes).

[Heroic and Mythic only] During intermissions, avoid the huge beams from the boss.
Mythic: The cannon you destroy goes haywire and buffs it instead of destroying it and removing it from the fight
If you "destroy" the soak cannon, you get 2x Soaks. If you "destroy" the move out circle one it will do random stuns

### Additional Notes
- The hits from the boss do not consume bone shield charges (confirmed, to not be a bug) {.spec-blood}
- You can torpedo away from the boss when bombardment timer is ~1s and be safe from all hits for extra DPS time {.spec-brew}
